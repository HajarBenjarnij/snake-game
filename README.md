# snake-game
The snake game is a very popular and fun game. Every time the snake eats the fruit, its length grows longer that makes the game more difficult . The objective of this python project is to build a snake game project. In this python project, the player has to move a snake so it touches the fruit. If the snake touches itself or the border of the game then the game will over. I had added also stages , if the score of player increase the acceleration of snake increase too. To build the snake game project we used the turtle module, pygame module, time module, and concept of python.
